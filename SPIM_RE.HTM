<h1><a name="SECTION00010000000000000000">1 SPIM</a></h1>
<p>SPIM S20 is a simulator that runs programs for the MIPS R2000/R3000 RISC 
computers. SPIM can read and immediately execute files containing assembly language 
or MIPS executable files. SPIM is a self-contained system for running these 
programs and contains a debugger and interface to a few operating system services. 
</p>
<p>The architecture of the MIPS computers is simple and regular, which makes 
it easy to learn and understand. The processor contains 32 general-purpose registers 
and a well-designed instruction set that make it a propitious target for generating 
code in a compiler. </p>
<p>However, the obvious question is: why use a simulator when many people have 
workstations that contain a hardware, and hence significantly faster, implementation 
of this computer? One reason is that these workstations are not generally available. 
Another reason is that these machine will not persist for many years because 
of the rapid progress leading to new and faster computers. Unfortunately, the 
trend is to make computers faster by executing several instructions concurrently, 
which makes their architecture more difficult to understand and program. The 
MIPS architecture may be the epitome of a simple, clean RISC machine. </p>
<p>In addition, simulators can provide a better environment for low-level programming 
than an actual machine because they can detect more errors and provide more 
features than an actual computer. For example, SPIM has a X-window interface 
that is better than most debuggers for the actual machines. </p>
<p>Finally, simulators are an useful tool for studying computers and the programs 
that run on them. Because they are implemented in software, not silicon, they 
can be easily modified to add new instructions, build new systems such as multiprocessors, 
or simply to collect data. </p>
<h2><a name="SECTION00011000000000000000">1.1 Simulation of a Virtual Machine</a></h2>
<p>The MIPS architecture, like that of most RISC computers, is difficult to 
program directly because of its delayed branches, delayed loads, and restricted 
address modes. This difficulty is tolerable since these computers were designed 
to be programmed in high-level languages and so present an interface designed 
for compilers, not programmers. A good part of the complexity results from delayed 
instructions. A <em>delayed branch</em> takes two cycles to execute. In the 
second cycle, the instruction immediately following the branch executes. This 
instruction can perform useful work that normally would have been done before 
the branch or it can be a <tt>nop</tt> (no operation). Similarly, <em>delayed 
loads</em> take two cycles so the instruction immediately following a load cannot 
use the value loaded from memory. </p>
<p>MIPS wisely choose to hide this complexity by implementing a <em>virtual 
machine</em> with their assembler. This virtual computer appears to have non-delayed 
branches and loads and a richer instruction set than the actual hardware. The 
assembler <em>reorganizes</em> (rearranges) instructions to fill the delay slots. 
It also simulates the additional, <em>pseudoinstructions</em> by generating 
short sequences of actual instructions. </p>
<p>By default, SPIM simulates the richer, virtual machine. It can also simulate 
the actual hardware. We will describe the virtual machine and only mention in 
passing features that do not belong to the actual hardware. In doing so, we 
are following the convention of MIPS assembly language programmers (and compilers), 
who routinely take advantage of the extended machine. Instructions marked with 
a dagger (?) are pseudoinstructions. </p>
<h2><a name="SECTION00012000000000000000">1.2 SPIM Interface</a></h2>
<p>SPIM provides a simple terminal and a X-window interface. Both provide equivalent 
functionality, but the X interface is generally easier to use and more informative. 
</p>
<p><tt>spim</tt>, the terminal version, and <tt>xspim</tt>, the X version, have 
the following command-line options: 
<dl>
    <dt><tt>-bare</tt> 
    <dd>Simulate a bare MIPS machine without pseudoinstructions or the additional 
    addressing modes provided by the assembler. Implies <tt>-quiet</tt>. 
    <dt><tt>-asm</tt> 
    <dd>Simulate the virtual MIPS machine provided by the assembler. This is 
    the default. 
    <dt><tt>-notrap</tt> 
    <dd>Do not load the standard trap handler. This trap handler has two functions 
    that must be assumed by the user's program. First, it handles traps. When 
    a trap occurs, SPIM jumps to location 0x80000080, which should contain code 
    to service the exception. Second, this file contains startup code that invokes 
    the routine <tt>main</tt>. Without the trap handler, execution begins at 
    the instruction labeled <tt>__start</tt>. 
    <dt><tt>-trap</tt> 
    <dd>Load the standard trap handler. This is the default. 
    <dt><tt>-noquiet</tt> 
    <dd>Print a message when an exception occurs. This is the default. 
    <dt><tt>-quiet</tt> 
    <dd>Do not print a message at an exception. 
    <dt><tt>-nomapped_io</tt> 
    <dd>Disable the memory-mapped IO facility (see Section <a href="node5.html#secIO">5</a>). 
    
    <dt><tt>-mapped_io</tt> 
    <dd>Enable the memory-mapped IO facility (see Section <a href="node5.html#secIO">5</a>). 
    Programs that use SPIM syscalls (see Section <a href="node1.html#secscall">1.5</a>) 
    to read from the terminal should not also use memory-mapped IO. 
    <dt><tt>-file</tt> 
    <dd>Load and execute the assembly code in the file. 
    <dt><tt>-execute</tt> 
    <dd>Load and execute the code in the MIPS executable file <em>a.out</em>. 
    
    <dt><tt>-s seg size</tt> 
    <dd>Sets the initial size of memory segment <em>seg</em> to be <em>size</em> 
    bytes. The memory segments are named: <tt>text</tt>, <tt>data</tt>, <tt>stack</tt>, 
    <tt>ktext</tt>, and <tt>kdata</tt>. For example, the pair of arguments <tt>-sdata 
    2000000</tt> starts the user data segment at 2,000,000 bytes. 
    <dt><tt>-lseg size</tt> 
    <dd>Sets the limit on how large memory segment <em>seg</em> can grow to 
    be <em>size</em> bytes. The memory segments that can grow are: <tt>data</tt>, 
    <tt>stack</tt>, and <tt>kdata</tt>. 
</dl>
<h3><a name="SECTION00012100000000000000">1.2.1 Terminal Interface</a></h3>
<p>The terminal interface (<tt>spim</tt>) provides the following commands: 
<dl>
    <dt><tt>exit</tt> 
    <dd>Exit the simulator. 
    <dt><tt>read &quot;file&quot;</tt> 
    <dd>Read <em>file</em> of assembly language commands into SPIM's memory. 
    If the file has already been read into SPIM, the system should be cleared 
    (see <tt>reinitialize</tt>, below) or global symbols will be multiply defined. 
    
    <dt><tt>load &quot;file&quot;</tt> 
    <dd>Synonym for <tt>read</tt>. 
    <dt><tt>execute &quot;a.out&quot;</tt> 
    <dd>Read the MIPS executable file <em>a.out</em> into SPIM's memory. 
    <dt><tt>run &lt;addr&gt;</tt> 
    <dd>Start running a program. If the optional address <em>addr</em> is provided, 
    the program starts at that address. Otherwise, the program starts at the 
    global symbol <tt>__start</tt>, which is defined by the default trap handler 
    to call the routine at the global symbol <tt>main</tt> with the usual MIPS 
    calling convention. 
    <dt><tt>step &lt;N&gt;</tt> 
    <dd>Step the program for <em>N</em> (default: 1) instructions. Print instructions 
    as they execute. 
    <dt><tt>continue</tt> 
    <dd>Continue program execution without stepping. 
    <dt><tt>print $N</tt> 
    <dd>Print register <em>N</em>. 
    <dt><tt>print $fN</tt> 
    <dd>Print floating point register <em>N</em>. 
    <dt><tt>print addr</tt> 
    <dd>Print the contents of memory at address <em>addr</em>. 
    <dt><tt>print_sym</tt> 
    <dd>Print the contents of the symbol table, i.e., the addresses of the global 
    (but not local) symbols. 
    <dt><tt>reinitialize</tt> 
    <dd>Clear the memory and registers. 
    <dt><tt>breakpoint addr</tt> 
    <dd>Set a breakpoint at address <em>addr</em>. <em>addr</em> can be either 
    a memory address or symbolic label. 
    <dt><tt>delete addr</tt> 
    <dd>Delete all breakpoints at address <em>addr</em>. 
    <dt><tt>list</tt> 
    <dd>List all breakpoints. 
    <dt><tt>.</tt> 
    <dd>Rest of line is an assembly instruction that is stored in memory. 
    <dt><tt>&lt;nl&gt;</tt> 
    <dd>A newline reexecutes previous command. 
    <dt><tt>?</tt> 
    <dd>Print a help message. 
</dl>
<p>Most commands can be abbreviated to their unique prefix e.g., <tt>ex</tt>, 
<tt>re</tt>, <tt>l</tt>, <tt>ru</tt>, <tt>s</tt>, <tt>p</tt>. More dangerous 
commands, such as <tt>reinitialize</tt>, require a longer prefix. </p>
<h3><a name="SECTION00012200000000000000">1.2.2 X-Window Interface</a></h3>
<p><centre> <br>
<strong>Figure:</strong> X-window interface to SPIM.<br>
<br>
The X version of SPIM, <tt>xspim</tt>, looks different, but should operate in 
the same manner as <tt>spim</tt>. The X window has five panesi. The top pane 
displays the contents of the registers. It is continually updated, except while 
a program is running. </p>
<p>The next pane contains the buttons that control the simulator: 
<dl>
    <dt><b>quit</b> 
    <dd>Exit from the simulator. 
    <dt><b>load</b> 
    <dd>Read a source or executable file into memory. 
    <dt><b>run</b> 
    <dd>Start the program running. 
    <dt><b>step</b> 
    <dd>Single-step through a program. 
    <dt><b>clear</b> 
    <dd>Reinitialize registers or memory. 
    <dt><b>set value</b> 
    <dd>Set the value in a register or memory location. 
    <dt><b>print</b> 
    <dd>Print the value in a register or memory location. 
    <dt><b>breakpoint</b> 
    <dd>Set or delete a breakpoint or list all breakpoints. 
    <dt><b>help</b> 
    <dd>Print a help message. 
    <dt><b>terminal</b> 
    <dd>Raise or hide the console window. 
    <dt><b>mode</b> 
    <dd>Set SPIM operating modes. 
</dl>
<p>The next two panes display the memory contents. The top one shows instructions 
from the user and kernel text segments.<a href="footnode.html#157" name="tex2html4">[+]</a> 
The first few instructions in the text segment are startup code (<tt>__start</tt>) 
that loads <tt>argc</tt> and <tt>argv</tt> into registers and invokes the <tt>main</tt> 
routine. </p>
<p>The lower of these two panes displays the data and stack segments. Both panes 
are updated as a program executes. </p>
<p>The bottom pane is used to display messages from the simulator. It does not 
display output from an executing program. When a program reads or writes, its 
IO appears in a separate window, called the Console, which pops up when needed. 
</p>
<h2><a name="SECTION00013000000000000000">1.3 Surprising Features</a></h2>
<p>Although SPIM faithfully simulates the MIPS computer, it is a simulator and 
certain things are not identical to the actual computer. The most obvious differences 
are that instruction timing and the memory systems are not identical. SPIM does 
not simulate caches or memory latency, nor does it accurate reflect the delays 
for floating point operations or multiplies and divides. </p>
<p>Another surprise (which occurs on the real machine as well) is that a pseudoinstruction 
expands into several machine instructions. When single-stepping or examining 
memory, the instructions that you see are slightly different from the source 
program. The correspondence between the two sets of instructions is fairly simple 
since SPIM does not reorganize the instructions to fill delay slots. </p>
<h2><a name="SECTION00014000000000000000">1.4 Assembler Syntax</a></h2>
<p><a name="secsyntax">&nbsp;</a> </p>
<p>Comments in assembler files begin with a sharp-sign (<tt>#</tt>). Everything 
from the sharp-sign to the end of the line is ignored. </p>
<p>Identifiers are a sequence of alphanumeric characters, underbars (<tt>_</tt>), 
and dots (<tt>.</tt>) that do not begin with a number. Opcodes for instructions 
are reserved words that are <b>not</b> valid identifiers. Labels are declared 
by putting them at the beginning of a line followed by a colon, for example: 
</p>
<pre>        .data
  item: .word 1
        .text
        .globl main             # Must be global
  main: lw $t0, item</pre>
<p>Strings are enclosed in double-quotes (<tt>&quot;</tt>). Special characters 
in strings follow the C convention: </p>
<pre>    newline        \n
    tab            \t
    quote          \&quot;</pre>
<p>SPIM supports a subset of the assembler directives provided by the MIPS assembler: 

<dl>
    <dt><tt>.align n</tt> 
    <dd>Align the next datum on a 2-byte boundary. For example, <tt>.align 2</tt> 
    aligns the next value on a word boundary. <tt>.align 0</tt> turns off automatic 
    alignment of <tt>.half</tt>, <tt>.word</tt>, <tt>.float</tt>, and <tt>.double</tt> 
    directives until the next <tt>.data</tt> or <tt>.kdata</tt> directive. 
    <dt><tt>.ascii str</tt> 
    <dd>Store the string in memory, but do not null-terminate it. 
    <dt><tt>.asciiz str</tt> 
    <dd>Store the string in memory and null-terminate it. 
    <dt><tt>.byte b1, ..., bn</tt> 
    <dd>Store the <i>n</i> values in successive bytes of memory. 
    <dt><tt>.data &lt;addr&gt;</tt> 
    <dd>The following data items should be stored in the data segment. If the 
    optional argument <em>addr</em> is present, the items are stored beginning 
    at address <em>addr</em>. 
    <dt><tt>.double d1, ..., dn</tt> 
    <dd>Store the <i>n</i> floating point double precision numbers in successive 
    memory locations. 
    <dt><tt>.extern sym size</tt> 
    <dd>Declare that the datum stored at <tt>sym</tt> is <tt>size</tt> bytes 
    large and is a global symbol. This directive enables the assembler to store 
    the datum in a portion of the data segment that is efficiently accessed 
    via register <tt>$gp</tt>. 
    <dt><tt>.float f1, ..., fn</tt> 
    <dd>Store the <i>n</i> floating point single precision numbers in successive 
    memory locations. 
    <dt><tt>.globl sym</tt> 
    <dd>Declare that symbol <tt>sym</tt> is global and can be referenced from 
    other files. 
    <dt><tt>.half h1, ..., hn</tt> 
    <dd>Store the <i>n</i> 16-bit quantities in successive memory halfwords. 
    
    <dt><tt>.kdata &lt;addr&gt;</tt> 
    <dd>The following data items should be stored in the kernel data segment. 
    If the optional argument <em>addr</em> is present, the items are stored 
    beginning at address <em>addr</em>. 
    <dt><tt>.ktext &lt;addr&gt;</tt> 
    <dd>The next items are put in the kernel text segment. In SPIM, these items 
    may only be instructions or words (see the <tt>.word</tt> directive below). 
    If the optional argument <em>addr</em> is present, the items are stored 
    beginning at address <em>addr</em>. 
    <dt><tt>.space n</tt> 
    <dd>Allocate <i>n</i> bytes of space in the current segment (which must 
    be the data segment in SPIM). 
    <dt><tt>.text &lt;addr&gt;</tt> 
    <dd>The next items are put in the user text segment. In SPIM, these items 
    may only be instructions or words (see the <tt>.word</tt> directive below). 
    If the optional argument <em>addr</em> is present, the items are stored 
    beginning at address <em>addr</em>. 
    <dt><tt>.word w1, ..., wn</tt> 
    <dd>Store the <i>n</i> 32-bit quantities in successive memory words. 
</dl>
<p>SPIM does not distinguish various parts of the data segment (<tt>.data</tt>, 
<tt>.rdata</tt>, and <tt>.sdata</tt>). </p>
<h2><a name="SECTION00015000000000000000">1.5 System Calls</a></h2>
<p><a name="secscall">&nbsp;</a> </p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p><br>
<strong>Table:</strong> System services.<br></p>
<p>SPIM provides a small set of operating-system-like services through the system 
call (<tt>syscall</tt>) instruction. To request a service, a program loads the 
system call code (see Table <a href="node1.html#tabsyscall">1</a>) into register 
<tt>$v0</tt> and the arguments into registers <tt>$a0 . . . $a3</tt> (or <tt>$f12</tt> 
for floating point values). System calls that return values put their result 
in register <tt>$v0</tt> (or <tt>$f0</tt> for floating point results). For example, 
to print ``<tt>the answer = 5</tt>'', use the commands: </p>
<pre>        .data
  str:  .asciiz &quot;the answer = &quot;
        .text
        li $v0, 4        # system call code for print_str
        la $a0, str      # address of string to print
        syscall          # print the string
&nbsp;
        li $v0, 1        # system call code for print_int
        li $a0, 5        # integer to print
        syscall          # print it</pre>
<p><tt>print_int</tt> is passed an integer and prints it on the console. <tt>print_float</tt> 
prints a single floating point number. <tt>print_double</tt> prints a double 
precision number. <tt>print_string</tt> is passed a pointer to a null-terminated 
string, which it writes to the console. </p>
<p><tt>read_int</tt>, <tt>read_float</tt>, and <tt>read_double</tt> read an 
entire line of input up to and including the newline. Characters following the 
number are ignored. <tt>read_string</tt> has the same semantics as the Unix 
library routine <tt>fgets</tt>. It reads up to<i> n - 1</i> characters into 
a buffer and terminates the string with a null byte. If there are fewer characters 
on the current line, it reads through the newline and again null-terminates 
the string. <b>Warning:</b> programs that use these syscalls to read from the 
terminal should not use memory-mapped IO (see Section 5). </p>
<p><tt>sbrk</tt> returns a pointer to a block of memory containing <i>n</i> 
additional bytes. <tt>exit</tt> stops a program from running. </p>
